Building libpatts
=================

libpatts is designed for Unix-like systems and is built using the GNU build
system.

Requirements
============

| Library | Purpose               |
|---------+-----------------------|
| libsqon | Database connectivity |

Installing the Dependencies
---------------------------

You will need to build libsqon manually, unless your software distribution
packages it for you. The following should work on any GNU system.

    $ wget http://delwink.com/dl/libsqon-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
    $ tar xzf libsqon-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
    $ cd libsqon-X.Y.Z
    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    # make install

Take a look at libsqon's INSTALL file for more details on building it and
properly installing it for your operating system.

### Debian GNU/Linux (and derivatives)

    # apt-get install build-essential autoconf automake libtool

### Parabola GNU/Linux-libre

    # pacman -S base-devel
