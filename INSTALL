Building and installing libpatts
================================

libpatts is designed for Unix-like systems and is built using the GNU build
system.

Requirements
============

| Library | Purpose                  |
|---------+--------------------------|
| libsqon | Database connectivity    |
| Jansson | Internal JSON management |

Installing the Dependencies
---------------------------

You will likely need to build libsqon manually, unless your software
distribution packages it for you. The following should work on any GNU system.

    $ wget http://delwink.com/dl/libsqon-delX.Y.Z.tar.gz
    $ tar xzf libsqon-delX.Y.Z.tar.gz
    $ cd libsqon-delX.Y.Z
    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    # make install

Take a look at libsqon's INSTALL file for more details on building it and
properly installing it for your operating system.

### Debian GNU/Linux (and derivatives)

    # apt-get install build-essential autoconf automake libtool
    # apt-get install libjansson-dev

### Parabola GNU/Linux-libre

    # pacman -S base-devel
    # pacman -S jansson

Building libpatts
-----------------

libpatts follows the GNU build process, using the autotools. Execute the
following commands in the root directory of the source distribution.

    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ ./configure
    $ make

Installing libpatts
-------------------

The most basic install can be done with GNU make.

    # make install

A safer installation can be done using a tool called checkinstall.

    # checkinstall

If using checkinstall, you may want to add `--prefix=/usr` when executing
`./configure` to install the library to the usual directories on a GNU/Linux
system.
